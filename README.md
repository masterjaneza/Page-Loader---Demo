## 🧠 What's Inside

This is the `client/src` portion of the repo. It houses the core front-end magic:

- ✨ `index.html` – The entry point, minimal and clean.
- 🎨 `styles.css` – Light styling to keep the UI fresh.
- ⚙️ `script.js` – Handles dynamic loading of HTML content without full page refreshes.
